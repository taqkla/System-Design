/**
 * **Interface Segregation Principle** A client should never be forced to implement an
 * interface/class that it doesn’t use, or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do
 * not use.
 * Example: Imagine a TV remote control.A basic TV remote has buttons like power, volume,
 * and channel control.Now, imagine if this remote also had buttons for making coffee, opening your
 * garage, and feeding your pet.That would be overwhelming and confusing, right ? You'd have to
 * navigate through buttons you never use to find the ones you actually need. The Interface
 * Segregation Principle suggests that it's better to have specialised remotes for specialised
 * tasks.
